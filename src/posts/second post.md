I was walking down the street today when I saw a man walking his dog. The dog was wearing a hat, and I couldn't help but laugh. I mean, who puts a hat on a dog?

I started to walk faster so I could catch up to the man and ask him why he had put a hat on his dog. But before I could, the dog started to bark at me. And not just any bark. It was a really loud, aggressive bark.

I was so scared that I ran away. I didn't even get to ask the man why he had put a hat on his dog.

But I'm still laughing about it. I mean, who puts a hat on a dog?

## The moral of the story

Don't put a hat on a dog if you don't want it to bark at you.
